# Tacos Herzo
Tacos Herzo is a website for an imaginary Mexican food restaurant in the heart of Herzogenaurach in Bayern, Germany.
The main purpose of the Tacos Herzo is to increase the number of table reservations for its restaurant.
This is achieved by clearly presenting the dishes and drinks we serve in our Menu which is shown directly in the Homepage.
As some people would like to see how our dishes are served, Tacos Herzo also shows pictures of the dishes in a gallery page.
