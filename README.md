# Tacos Herzo
Tacos Herzo is a website for an imaginary Mexican food restaurant in the heart of Herzogenaurach (Herzo as it's called) in Bayern, Germany. The website is intended for anyone who is interested in trying out Mexican food in Herzo as well for returning customers.

The main purpose of the Tacos Herzo is to increase the number of table reservations for its restaurant.
This is achieved by clearly presenting the dishes and drinks we serve in our Menu which is shown directly in the Homepage. As some people would like to see how our dishes are served, Tacos Herzo also shows pictures of the dishes in a gallery page.
